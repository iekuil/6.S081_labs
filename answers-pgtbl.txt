1. the syscall uptime.
    In memory, a page is allocated to store the values of ticks. 
    Map the corresponding address to the same physical page in each process's page table and assign read-only permission. 
    Each time a time-slice interrupt occurs, 
    the corresponding interrupt handler updates the values within the physical page

2. page0 flag: UXWRV, 
    page2 flag: UXWRV,
    so they are both text section.

    page1 flag: XWRV, so it can't be read or wrote by user code.

    the third to last page flag: RV, so it should be the kernel code
