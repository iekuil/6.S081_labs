1. 
    normally a0-a7.
    in this case: a0, a1, a2;
    and a2 holds the value 13

2. 
    The statement in which the main function calls f is optimized away by the compiler, 
    so the main function does not call f.

    f calls g at offset 14

3. 0x630

4. 0x38

5. 
    the output should be "He110 World";
    i should be 0x726c6400;
    just keep 57616 the statement

6. 
    when calling printf, the argument 3 comes from the a2 register,
    but the code doesn't modify the value in a2, 
    so the output could be anything depends on the status of executing.
